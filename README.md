## List of Experiments

Below a list of the experiments contained in this repository and hosted on github pages

### Three.js

#### [Displacement Shader](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/three/displacement)

The above experiment is a simple vertex displacement shader with a simple height fragment shader (eg, higher the displacement, brighter the emissive color of the mesh). Renderer has the [UnrealBloom](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_postprocessing_unreal_bloom.html) postprocess effect applied to it.

#### [GLTF Loader](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/three/arc170)

Demo of the glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) file loader. [ARC-170 Fighter Model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/arc-170-fighter-d2b9834148e84c86a2423148db1f6705) by courtesy of SketchFab.

## List of Experiments

Below a list of the experiments contained in this repository and hosted on github pages

### Three.js / Three-Fiber

- [Displacement Shader](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/three/displacement)

  The above experiment is a simple vertex displacement shader with a simple height fragment shader (eg, higher the displacement, brighter the emissive color of the mesh). Renderer has the [UnrealBloom](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_postprocessing_unreal_bloom.html) postprocess effect applied to it.

- [GLTF Loader](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/three/arc170)

  Demo of the glTF‚Ñ¢ (GL Transmission Format) file loader. [ARC-170 Fighter Model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/arc-170-fighter-d2b9834148e84c86a2423148db1f6705) by courtesy of SketchFab.

- [Audio Visualizer](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/three/audio-visualizer)

  Music visualizer using AudioContext APIs. Uses an `<audio>` tag to load and play the source and read the audiostream from.

### Javascript

- [MatterJS Repulsor](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/javascript/matter-repulsor)

  This MatterJS experiment uses springs on a grid to simulate a pattern and makes use of the matter-attractors base plugin with a custom function to reverse its attractor effect.

### CSS3

- [Ticker Typography](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/css/ticker-typography)

- [Twist Typography](https://experiments.luigimannoni.com/#/css/twist-typography)

## Local development

As usual `npm install` and `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Run `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
